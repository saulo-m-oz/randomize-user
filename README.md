# Randomize User

This application is a recreation of an existing interface that randomizes a user everytime you access the page. You can see it here: https://randomuser.me/

## Setup

To run locally you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies by running

```sh
pnpm install
```

Also make sure that you have the <code>.env</code> set with <code>VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://randomuser.me/api</code>.

After everything is installed and you .env created, you can initialize a dev server by running

```sh

```
This will allow you to access the application through your localhost.
